**Read Along**

Read-along text will highlight the words as the audio for the sentence is being played. Please follow instructions in the read-along wizard to create one.

***Autoplay***

Set the Read-along text to autoplay and it will automatically start as the child navigates to this stage.

***Pro tip***

Change the text styling options to make the read-along text stand out from regular text. This will prompt the child to interact with it.
